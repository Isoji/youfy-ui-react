# Youfy Extension UI

UI skeleton made by [Rishit Patel](https://rishitpatel.com/) in React for Youfy Project - CIS 354

## Project Description

This project aims to facilitate the life of Spotify users. In this project, we will develop a Google Chrome extension that aims to get YouTube playlists/songs and passes those to the userâ€™s Spotify account, so the user will not have to find the same songs on both platforms.

By installing the extension, a new button will appear on YouTube for the user. By pressing that button, the user will be able to import the current playlist/song to their Spotify account, saving the user some time.
